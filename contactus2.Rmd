I am a data scientist and atmospheric chemist living in Sunny Southern 
California. I take great pride in providing high quality, science-based 
solutions that meet client needs.

I earned a BS in Chemistry from Creighton University and my PhD in Atmospheric 
Chemistry at the University of California at Berkeley, where I measured and 
modeled stable isotopic compositions of the trace stratospheric gases CH~4~, 
CO~2~, and H~2~ to help constrain atmospheric greenhouse gas budgets.
